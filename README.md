# House prices: Ensemble and a comprehensive EDA (keep updating)

## Executive Summary:

I started the competition by focusing on detailed data exploration just to have a great grasp of the dataset, which is very useful for dealing with missing value and conducting effective feature engineering. EDA process will be introduced here with many visualizations. This project includes

•	**Imputing missing values** by processing sequentially through each feature

•	**Transforming** some numerical variables that are actually categorical 

•	**Scaling** all numerical variables

•	**Label Encoding** the categorical variables that are ordinal

•	**Getting dummy variables** for  all categorical features

•	Pipeline of Lasso regression

•	Random Forest pipeline

•	XGBoost

•	Stacking
